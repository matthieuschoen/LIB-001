How work the function int_parser ?

- First we will define a integer "sign" -> will be used to find the sign before
the integer.

- In the second time we will check the sign -> if the input is equal to '-' :
    * We will give -1 to sign because it's a negative value
    * We will skip the '-' with "input"

- In the third time we will :
    * Check if the "input" is a digit (with a simple isdigit function)
    * We will convert the "input" to his numeric version with - '0'
    * After we add this value to "result" and multiply it by 10 (decimal)

- At the end we :
    * Add the sign to the "result" -> (*result *= sign)
